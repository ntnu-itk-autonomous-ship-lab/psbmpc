# Cuda Matrix Library (Trym's ad hoc matrix library)
<p> This is a matrix library created for use in CUDA when running the PSB-MPC on the GPU. It is based on the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) idiom. As of now, only the Dynamic_Matrix should be use, as the Static_Matrix or fixed-size matrix class is not compatible yet. This is because I have not implemented functionality that allows mixing of both dynamic and static matrices yet.  </p>
