# PSB-MPC ROS1 package

This package contains functionality for running the PSB-MPC in a ROS1 framework. Mainly the GPU PSB-MPC has been tested. The package has a Dynamic Obstacle Manager (DOM) node and a Grounding Hazard Manager (GHM) node for handling obstacles, a visualization node (for RViz), and the core MPC functionality in the PSB-MPC node. Services for changing mode between the SB-MPC and PSB-MPC, loading waypoints and getting an updated list of polygons exist.
